;;; Commentary:

;; Interaction capabilities live on retained nodes.  Composition copies the
;; lines of an interactive node and fills absent `ebox-node', `keymap',
;; `help-echo', `pointer' and `mouse-face' properties, so the innermost node
;; wins, an explicit nil blocks inheritance, and an ancestor's keymap reaches
;; descendants without their own.
;; Focus and the held pointer target are mount state; they surface as the
;; derived selector states focus and active, and :disabled t derives disabled.

The node's text becomes the session value with the caret at its end.  Keys
typed in the buffer while the session is active edit that value with their
ordinary Emacs commands: insertion, deletion, motion, kill and yank, undo,
the region and input methods.  The node keeps its layout and displays each
edit immediately, so wrapping, padding and borders stay in place; point
follows the caret and a click inside the node's box moves it.

OPTIONS is a plist.  :on-change is called with the new value after each
command that changes it.  :keymap holds bindings consulted first; they run
in BUFFER-OR-NAME, except the commands in `ebox-input-edit-commands', which
edit the value.  :on-leave is called without arguments when a later click lands
outside the node's box; the opening gesture is not a leave event.
:local-variables is an alist of buffer-local
settings, such as `completion-at-point-functions', for the commands editing
the value.  :caret is a value offset placing the caret; without it a fresh
session opens at the end, while a session whose node text is unchanged
since the last one reuses its editing buffer and keeps the previous caret,
region and undo history.  Setting the node's text to another string
replaces the value and clears its undo history.
