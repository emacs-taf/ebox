;;; ebox-viewport.el --- Event-loop viewport delivery -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Emacs owns window events; Ebox owns the mounted viewport.  This module is
;; the single bridge between them.  Size and buffer-change hooks record frame
;; intents; one task samples current visible dimensions and refits mounts after
;; the drag settles.  A text scale change is a viewport intent too: it changes
;; every measured glyph, so one task refreshes the glyph caches and lays the
;; scaled mounts out again after the scale settles.
